abstract = {Dynamics of the subsurface (2–3 m) mesozooplankton (i.e., {\textgreater} 200 $\mu$m) in the Bay of Calvi (Corsica, France) were explored, combining time series (2004–2016) of 14 zooplankton groups, wind gusts, water temperature, nitrate and chlorophyll-a. Zooplankton data was obtained through image analysis. While contrasted group-specific seasonal patterns were observed, the most productive zooplankton annual event occurred in April (spring peak), concentrating on average 25{\%} of the total annual abundance. A “typical” year was defined based on the annual succession of different community states, highlighting particular years (2007, 2015 and 2012) mainly characterized by weak spring peak. Environmental influences on the interannual variability of zooplankton were explored and while relationship between chlorophyll-a and zooplankton abundance was unclear, the availability of nutrients (December–March), potentially mediated via the wind regime (October–January) seemed to be essential to the occurrence of the spring peak. Additionally, we observed an influence of temperature, with winter thermal thresholds (between 12.1 °C and 13.4 °C) conditioning the spring peak. Also, the occurrence of lower annual abundances after 2010 was synchronous with the sharp increase of seawater warming trend, especially regarding winter temperature (0.30 °C.year−1). Finally, winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was found to be correlated to both winter water temperature and spring peak abundance, which suggests large-scale processes to impact regional zooplankton community.},
